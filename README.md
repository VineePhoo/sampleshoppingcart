MAven,TestNG,Java,Selenium,Cucumber

This is a sample project automated an online shopping cart using selenium,cucumber,java,testng and maven.
There are three projects such as framework, test suite and domain service object (dso).
These three projects are independet each other and they can be developed as separate projects.

This sample online web site is not defined HTML elements properly. So to reduce flakyness, I have used some programming techniques to locate elements.
